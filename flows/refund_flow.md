# Refund & Cancellation Flow

1. **User initiates cancellation**
   - Capture booking reference and reason.

2. **Operator policy check**
   - Query operator cancellation policy (full/partial/no refund).

3. **Offer alternatives**
   - Reschedule to next available seat (preferred).
   - Issue credit for future booking if operator provides.

4. **Process refund**
   - If refund allowed → confirm amount and timeline.
   - If refund not allowed → explain policy clearly and politely, escalate if needed.

5. **Completion**
   - Confirm refund/reschedule to user and log the case for service team follow-up.
